        <h2>Yom Kippur War (1973)</h2>
        <p class="details">
          The Yom Kippur War, also known as the October War, was fought between Egypt and Syria against Israel. It began on October 6, 1973, during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. Egypt’s primary objective was to reclaim the Sinai Peninsula, which it had lost to Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967.
          <br><br>
          The war started with a surprise attack, and Egypt successfully crossed the Suez Canal, breaching Israel’s Bar Lev Line. The conflict lasted until October 25, 1973, and resulted in heavy casualties on both sides. Although the war ended with no definitive victory, it led to diplomatic breakthroughs, including the Camp David Accords in 1978.

        <h2>War on Terror (2013–Present)</h2>
        <p class="details">
          Since 2013, Egypt has been engaged in a prolonged War on Terror, primarily in the Sinai Peninsula. This conflict targets extremist groups, including ISIS-affiliated organizations, that threaten national security. It began after increased militant activity in the aftermath of Egypt’s political unrest in 2011.
          <br><br>
          Egypt has launched numerous military operations, such as Operation Sinai 2018, to eradicate terrorist cells and secure the region. Despite challenges, the Egyptian Armed Forces have made significant progress in reducing militant activities. This ongoing war emphasizes Egypt’s commitment to ensuring stability and combating extremism.
